I am an Associate Professor of <a href=https://politicalscience.wvu.edu/>Political Science</a> at West Virginia University. Prior to coming to WVU, I received my PhD in <a href=https://polisci.wustl.edu/>Political Science from Washington University in St. Louis</a>, where I was a graduate associate for the <a href=http://cerl.wustl.edu/>Center for Empirical Research in the Law (CERL)</a>. In Fall 2019, I was a Fulbright Scholar at the <a href=https://www.jus.uio.no/pluricourts/english/>PluriCourts Centre</a> at the University of Oslo.<br>
<br>
My research lies at the intersection of judicial politics and public opinion. I focus primarily on comparative judicial institutions, with an emphasis on the consequences of these institutions for the performance of modern liberal democracy. In particular, my work examines the relationship between courts engaged in constitutional review and the elected branches of government. Primarily examining Western judiciaries, my research investigates how potential noncompliance with judicial decisions influences the exercise of constitutional review. My main project studies how constitutional courts can ensure the implementation of decisions by strategically using their discretion over procedural and institutional tools, such as public oral hearings, to alter the political environment in which courts issue their decisions. Another major project examines how political considerations structure the behavior of the Court of Justice of the European Union. In my newest project, supported by a fellowship from the WVU Humanities Center, I extend my work to consider the attitudes of indigenous peoples towards legal institutions. I am generally interested in comparative political institutions, including judicial, executive and legislative institutions, European and European Union politics, indigenous politics, political economy, formal theory, and political methodology.
<br>
<br>
  I am also a Co-PI (along with <a href=https://www.amandadriscoll.xyz/>Amanda Driscoll</a> of Florida State and <a href=http://mjnelson.org/>Michael Nelson</a> of Penn State) of the NSF-funded <a href=https://www.crisesandtheruleoflaw.com/>Crises and the Rule of Law project</a> in which we evaluate the public support for the rule of law in established and backsliding democracies. With over 40,000 survey responses collected from six countries between May 2020 and September 2021, our book manuscript <em>Public Support for the Rule of Law: Personal Convictions and Institutional Constraints</em> (under contract with <em>Cambridge University Press</em>) considers both the covariates of support for the rule of law and the limits of that support as a democratic guardrail.

Modern liberal democracies typically depend on courts with the power of constitutional review to ensure that elected officials do not breach their constitutional obligations. The efficacy of this review, however, can depend on the public observing such breaches. One resource available to many of the world's constitutional courts to influence the public's ability to do so is public oral hearings. Drawing on the comparative judicial literature on separation of powers, public awareness, and noncompliance, I develop a formal model of public oral hearings. The model provides empirical implications for when a court will hold public oral hearings and how hearings correspond to a court's willingness to rule against elected officials. An empirical analysis of hearings at the German Constitutional Court supports the model's prediction that courts use hearings as a resource to address potential noncompliance.

Scholars have long recognized the importance of timing in political decision making. In this paper, I consider the potential for the strategic timing of court decisions involving the constitutional review of statutes. As courts lack the ability to directly implement their decisions, scholars have identified an attentive public as invaluable for judicial authority. Building on this literature, I argue that the proximity of a national election increases awareness and thereby creates an environment conducive to the assertive exercise of constitutional review. I then present evidence of the electoral cycle's effect on decision making at the German Federal Constitutional Court.

Scholars have long debated the positive and negative consequences of an aware public for the quality of governance in modern liberal democracies. This paper extends this debate to the context of constitutional review by exploring how public awareness can limit the effective exercise of review by courts lacking strong public support. Incorporating aspects of both the legitimacy and separation of powers theories on judicial power, I argue that public awareness weakens the efficacy of such unpopular courts by creating an electoral incentive for governments to defy adverse rulings, even when doing so may lead to punishment from other institutional stakeholders. In this article, I develop a simple formal model that identifies how and under what conditions public awareness can influence an unpopular court's decision making. An analysis of rulings issued by the Court of Justice of the European Union finds support for the model's empirical implications.

Constitutional review has become a hallmark of modern liberal democracy. The efficacy of this review, however, is far from guaranteed. In this paper, I argue that courts promote compliance by using their discretion over the temporal effect of decisions invalidating legislation. Building on the comparative judicial politics literature on the separation of powers and strategic judicial behavior, I develop a theoretical account of how courts strategically delay the implementation of their decisions through the declaration of a statute's incompatibility with the constitution. The accompanying theoretical model's main prediction is that courts use this tactic when the incumbent government is electorally weak, as delaying compliance raises the probability of a new government taking office and subsequently implementing the decision. An empirical analysis of incompatibility rulings by the German Federal Constitutional Court supports the model’s predictions.

Understanding how high courts successfully constrain the state poses a puzzle central to the study of constitutional review. An increasingly popular answer to this puzzle is that voters electorally punish governments for noncompliance with judicial decisions. This paper conducts a cross-national analysis of the relationship between noncompliance and an incumbent government's electoral success. Using data from the Varieties of Democracy Project on noncompliance with the national high courts of 74 countries from 2007 to 2017, I examine whether voters systematically punish or reward noncompliance. The analysis reveals that noncompliance decreases an incumbent government's vote share in contexts with a strong pre-existing norm of compliance.</div>

How courts ensure the efficacy of their decisions poses one of the central challenges to the quality of modern liberal democracy. In this article, we consider how the ability of domestic courts to engage with their international counterparts through preliminary reference procedures can further this goal. Arguing that domestic courts use preliminary reference procedures to affect the probability their governments comply with adverse judicial decisions, we construct a formal model of the reference procedure and test a series of empirical implications with a novel dataset of domestic court cases involving the European Union's preliminary reference procedure. We find that courts are more likely to refer cases as the risk of noncompliance increases and that this relationship is conditioned by the level of public trust in the Court of Justice of the European Union and the position of a court in the domestic judicial hierarchy.</div>

The European Union increasingly relies on the willingness of citizens to support the delegation of authority from their national governments to European institutions. Major policy crises have the ability to profoundly shape public support and opposition to greater European integration. In this article, we consider the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for public support of greater European integration. We build on the utilitarian approaches to develop an account of the pandemic’s implications for citizens’ views on the need for more EU-level policy making. We contend that higher levels of concern for COVID-19 correspond to higher support for further European integration. We then go on to argue that this relationship is conditioned by ideology. We find support for our hypotheses using a nationally-representative survey of 4400 German respondents fielded in April and May 2020.</div>

Courts regularly delegate tasks to individual or small subsets of judges. While a substantial literature addresses delegation in the context of American courts, less is known about why and how courts delegate from a comparative perspective. With many of the world's high courts using chamber systems by which the court delegates cases to subsets of judges, this limitation of the extant literature leaves a number of empirical and theoretical questions unanswered. We argue that the threat of noncompliance presents one factor influencing the use chambers. From our expectation that cases with a greater risk for noncompliance will not be sent to chambers, we then derive empirical implications for case disposition and the willingness of a court to rule contrary to the legal merits in a case. An empirical analysis of chamber usage in preliminary reference cases at the Court of Justice of the European Union provides evidence supporting our account.</div>

A long tradition in political science holds that political institutions are designed for the benefit of the politicians who create them. Prominent among explanations for the creation and maintenance of effective judiciaries is the political insurance theory, which predicts higher levels of judicial independence where there is robust political competition. In this article, I consider the implications of political insurance theory for one of the most consequential organizational decisions for courts, the provision of panels or subsets of judges for rendering decisions. Identifying the ability of panels to provide political insurance, I contend that higher levels of political competition motivate the creation of panel systems in national high courts. An empirical analysis using an original dataset on the organic statutes of 106 high courts reveals a positive relationship between political competition and the use of panel systems, while further analysis shows that this relationship is limited to democracies.</div>

To effectively constrain the state, citizens must recognize executive overreach and coordinate around an appropriate response. We consider whether the separation of powers can inform the public about executive overreach and shape citizens’ responses to it. Drawing on a survey fielded on a nationally representative sample of Germans, we find that citizens withhold support from executives who contravene the orders of a co-equal branch of government, though transgressing a court has greater cost than ignoring a legislature and this cost increases with citizens’ support for the rule of law. We find that approval from neither courts nor legislatures boost support for an illegal executive action; their approval instead mutes the public’s response. These findings are consequential for our understanding of the institutional separation of powers in environments where the rule of law is under threat and underscore the importance of both institutional and cultural guardrails in preventing democratic backsliding or authoritarian consolidation.</div>

A growing body of research theorizes that partisanship can undermine democracy as citizens prioritize their political interests over abstract norms and values that are vital for democratic survival. We argue that crises might ameliorate intense partisanship by giving citizens clarity of the immediate threat posed to democratic stability. Focusing on the willingness of individuals to punish elites who violate the law, we draw on an experiment embedded in representative surveys of Germany, the United States, Hungary, and Poland to examine citizens’ sense of appropriate punishment for elites’ violation of a municipal mask-wearing ordinance. We find evidence of partisan bias in citizens’ willingness to support punishment in all four countries. But, in the two consolidated democracies, we find that concern about the Covid-19 crisis ameliorates partisan biases in punishment preferences: citizens who are most concerned about the crisis also model the most consistency in their willingness to hold copartisans into account.</div>

With democratic backsliding spreading globally, international courts increasingly find themselves serving as democratic guardrails. This task poses a challenge, as national governments may attempt to punish international courts for trying to constrain their backsliding agendas. Since a government’s calculus for attacking a court is likely influenced by public opinion, we consider the impact of partisanship on the extent of public support for backlash against international courts in backsliding democracies. We theorize that support for backlash is driven by more than partisanship alone. For government partisans, support for backlash decreases with support for the international organization to which the court belongs, while for opposition partisans it depends on their commitment to the democratic norms the court’s decision defends. We support our expectations by analyzing original survey data collected from Hungary in March 2022, immediately following a major pro-democracy decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union.

Explanations for the successful expansion and consolidation of the European Union and its legal system have long emphasized the importance of domestic courts sending preliminary references to the Court of Justice. Key to many of these theoretical accounts is the claim that domestic courts are better equipped to compel national governments to comply with EU law than the Court of Justice. Integrating insights from the comparative judicial politics literature into the context of the EU’s preliminary references system, we provide a theoretical and empirical foundation for this claim by arguing that incorporating domestic courts into the EU legal process enhances public support for expansive judicial interpretations of EU law. We go on to argue, however, that this transference of legitimacy depends on citizens’ views of the national and European courts. We support our argument with evidence from a preregistered survey experiment fielded in Germany.

The political actors who make policy often delegate their implementation to others. Yet for a variety of reasons, ranging from intransigence to incompetence, political agents tasked with implementation may not faithfully implement policies. If those charged with implementa- tion can frame their noncompliance in a way that engenders sympathy, implementors may be able to disrupt the policymaking process with limited public backlash. We examine if the public’s willingness to excuse noncompliance varies with the implementing actor’s rationale for its failing to carry out the policy. Drawing on a survey experiment fielded in Germany, we find that the public is more sympathetic to resource-based, rather than principled, jus- tifications for noncompliance, though the size of the effect is small. Further, contrary to fears that the pandemic would decay democratic functioning by leading citizens to be more forgiving of emergency-based inaction, we find no evidence that the public is more accepting of noncompliance justified on the base of the pandemic.</div>

In this book, we argue that the public's support for the rule of law provides a critical check on executives who may otherwise overstep the bounds of their constitutional authority. Drawing upon over 40,000 survey interviews collected during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in four established democracies---the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Germany---as well as in the backsliding democracies of Poland and Hungary, we demonstrate that the efficacy of this check depends critically on the ability of institutions---particularly independent courts---to signal credibly to citizens when governments have exceeded their legal authority. Where courts have been captured or support for the rule of law is low, executives can take actions under the guise of an ``emergency'' with relative impunity. The results speak to the vital role of independent courts to prevent democratic backsliding.

Perhaps no segment of the American population has as complex of a relationship with the legal system as Native Americans. On the one hand, the law, and the courts that enforce those laws, have long been used to denude Native peoples of their land, culture, and identity. Yet on the other hand, it is now that very same legal system upon which Native tribes rely for the preservation of their sovereignty and the enforcement of the rights and privileges accorded to Native peoples in treaties and subsequent legislation. This dependence on the protections provided by the Federal legal system has only become more apparent in recent times, as the Supreme Court takes on cases addressing the very nature of what it means to be the citizen of a Native American tribe and whether the reservations of some of the largest Native American tribes remain intact.
<br>
Despite the impact of the law and the courts for everyday life in Indian Country, we know surprisingly little about the attitudes of Native peoples’ toward these institutions. Building in part from my own experiences as a citizen of the Cherokee Nation of Okla- homa, my newest project addresses this gap in the existing literature by examining the complex nature of Natives Americans’ relationship with both the American and tribal legal systems. While Native Americans’ trust in state and federal courts may be tainted by past experiences with those institutions, I contend that high profile victories for tribes in state and federal courts have the capacity to shift attitudes. I further argue that the development of tribes’ own judicial systems, which allows tribes to integrate their own practices and traditions into a modern legal system, provides an avenue for building broader confidence in legal institutions. With the support of a fellowship from the West Virginia University Humanities Center, in Spring 2023 I will be collecting pilot data in the form of interviews with tribal leaders and community members from the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in North Carolina.

How can an international court expect to serve as a bulwark for democracy? This proposal develops a series of theory-motivated hypotheses and an accompanying survey-based research design to identify how and under what conditions an international court can protect democracy. We focus our argument on three factors. First, we argue that an international court’s effect on public support for democracy is conditioned by an individual’s attitude toward the court. As an individual’s trust in the court increases, the court will have a stronger impact. Second, we contend that the involvement of domestic institutions, particularly nonpartisan institutions such as courts and ombudsmen, in a case at an international court will strengthen its impact on public support for democratic norms. Third, we anticipate that the domestic political environment, specifically the proximity and competitiveness of national elections, will color citizens’ reception of international court decisions. Election campaigns may activate and magnify partisanship in ways that affect acceptance of an international court’s decision.

Does delegating the appointment of constitutional court judges to foreigners ensure judicial independence? While adopted by only a small number of countries, the idea has grown in popularity among both legal scholars and policy experts as a selection method because it creates a judiciary unbound by domestic political in- terests. It remains an open empirical question, however, whether foreign-appointed judges are indeed more independent than domestically-appointed judges. I contend that the independence of foreign-appointed judges is weakened by their lacking the legitimacy conveyed through appointment by domestic political institutions. An analysis of judicial behavior at the Andorran Constitutional Court finds that foreign-appointed judges are responsive to political conditions, specifically the na- tional electoral cycle, while judges appointed by the domestic legislature are not. This responsiveness, however, manifests only in the admission of cases, not case disposition.</div>
